            <p>Welcome to my GitHub page! Below you will find the coursework I have completed thus far.
            </p>
                <p>I am currently working hard to learn front end development so that I can shift careers. I spent twenty years in the Army and since retiring, I have struggled to find the balance of doing something I enjoy and earning money.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed coding in college and have found myself coming back to itwhether through self study or formal clases like Austin Code Academy. I am enjoying every minute of this road to a new career and I'm looking forward to showing off some really great code. Watch me grow!
